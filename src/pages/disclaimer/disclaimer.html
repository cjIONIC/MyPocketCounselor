    <p class="description"> This mobile application is intended for setting appointments, inquiries and knowing the latest events and quotes from the university’s Guidance and Testing Division (GTD). It is not a platform for counseling and doesn’t focus on emergency situations. Counseling is done outside the application which is face-to-face with a guidance counselor inside the Guidance Office. Incase of emergency, please call the SU Hotline to allow the GTD to quickly respond to your situation.</p>
